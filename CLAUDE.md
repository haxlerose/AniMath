# Claude Code Guidelines

This document outlines the quality standards that must be maintained when making changes to this codebase.

## Testing Requirements

**ALL CODE MUST BE WRITTEN USING TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT**
**FOLLOW A RED, GREEN, REFACTOR PATTERN**
Be sure to only test the public interfaces of classes, not the individual
private methods. We test the behavior, not the implementation.
